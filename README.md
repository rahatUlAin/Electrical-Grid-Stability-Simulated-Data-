# Electrical-Grid-Stability-Simulated-Data-
Applied Decision tree, Multilayer perceptron and Logistic regression for classification into stable and unstable system using features provided in Electrical Grid Stability Simulated Data Data Set dataset.
 Results
On partitioning data into 70-30 training validation split the accuracy is reported on validation set as.
Algorithm	Accuracy
Logistic regression 	0.904
Multilayer Perceptron	0.7536666666666667
Decision tree	1.0


Summary
Logistic regression is most efficient after Decision tree which learns the rules to give 100% accuracy while multilayer perceptron although better than guess is struggling to find the pattern in the data.
